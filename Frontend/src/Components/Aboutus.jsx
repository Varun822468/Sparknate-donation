        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Welcome to <strong>SparkNate</strong>, a purpose-driven fundraising platform dedicated to enabling meaningful change through secure, transparent, and impactful donations. Our goal is to bridge the gap between genuine causes and compassionate donors by ensuring every campaign hosted on our platform is verified and trustworthy.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          At SparkNate, we believe that even a small spark of kindness can ignite powerful waves of hope and transformation. Unlike open-to-all platforms, we carefully curate each fundraiser, conducting manual reviews and authenticity checks to ensure that your donations truly make a difference.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our mission is threefold: to promote transparency, maximize impact, and restore public trust in online giving. We are committed to removing ambiguity from charitable giving by providing clear campaign goals, regular updates, and real outcomes from each supported cause.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          SparkNate operates with the belief that impactful giving should be effortless and emotionally fulfilling. We focus on causes that matterâ€”ranging from emergency medical support and educational initiatives to community development and disaster relief. Every donation goes directly to the campaign without hidden fees or platform deductions.
        </p>
